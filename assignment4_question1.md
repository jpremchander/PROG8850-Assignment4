# PROG8850 Assignment 4 – Question 1

## Analysis and Integration of Database Migration Tools

### Selected Tools: Flyway and Liquibase

---

## 1. Overview and Key Features

### Flyway
- **Overview:**
  - Flyway is an open-source database migration tool that uses simple SQL scripts for versioned migrations. It is widely adopted for its simplicity and reliability.
- **Key Features:**
  - Supports SQL and Java-based migrations
  - Works with most relational databases
  - Easy CLI and API integration
  - Tracks schema version in a dedicated table
  - Supports undo and repeatable migrations (Teams edition)
  - Integrates with CI/CD tools

### Liquibase
- **Overview:**
  - Liquibase is a powerful open-source database schema change management tool. It uses XML, YAML, JSON, or SQL for defining migrations (called changelogs).
- **Key Features:**
  - Supports multiple file formats for migrations
  - Extensive rollback and change tracking
  - Works with most relational databases
  - Rich CLI, API, and UI integrations
  - Advanced diff and audit capabilities
  - Integrates with CI/CD tools

## 2. Comparison Table

| Feature                | Flyway                        | Liquibase                      |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Ease of Use**       | Very simple, SQL-based        | Flexible, but more complex    |
| **CI/CD Integration** | Native support, easy setup    | Native support, more options  |
| **Supported DBs**     | Most RDBMS                    | Most RDBMS + NoSQL (some)     |
| **Migration Format**  | SQL, Java                     | SQL, XML, YAML, JSON          |
| **Rollback Support**  | Limited (Teams)               | Extensive                     |
| **Change Tracking**   | Basic (schema version table)  | Advanced (audit, diff)        |

## 3. Integration Strategy for CI/CD

To integrate Flyway and Liquibase into a CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Repository Structure:**
   - Organize migration scripts in dedicated folders (e.g., `/flyway_migrations`, `/liquibase_changelogs`).
2. **Pipeline Steps:**
   - On code push or PR:
     - Spin up a test database instance
     - Run Flyway migrations (for simple, versioned changes)
     - Run Liquibase changelogs (for complex, auditable changes)
     - Run automated tests
     - Rollback or clean up as needed
3. **Automation:**
   - Use GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or similar tools to automate migration and testing steps.
   - Print deployment status to the console/logs.
4. **Best Practices:**
   - Ensure each migration is idempotent and reversible
   - Use environment variables for DB credentials
   - Store migration history and audit logs
